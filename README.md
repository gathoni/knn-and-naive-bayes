### Context of the Business Problem
<blockquote> Titanic, in full Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Titanic, was a British luxury passenger liner that sank on April 14th â€“ 15th, 1912, during its maiden voyage, en route to New York City from Southampton, England, killing about 1,500 passengers and ship personnel. One of the most famous tragedies in modern history and has been the subject of much scholarship and scientific speculation.</blockquote>

### Problem Statement
<blockquote>Using the K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier and given a number of features, predict whether a passenger onboard the Titanic survived the shipwreck.</blockquote>

### Experimental Research Design
<blockquote>True Experimental Research Design This is the methodology we will to use for this research experiment.

A true experiment research design is a type of experimental design used to test and reject or fail to reject a hypothesis by using statistical analysis as the means of investigation. This type of experiment can also be used to determine cause and effect relationships within groups.</blockquote>

The following are the assumptions that must be satisfied in order to use the true experiment research design :

<li>Control group and experimental group</li>
<li>Researcher - manipulated variable(s)</li>
<li>Random distribution</li>

### Evaluation Metrics
We will use the following metics to evalute the performance of our models:

<li>Accuracy score</li>
<li>Precission</li>
<li>F1 score</li>

### Project Plan
<li>Definition of the research question</li>
<li>Data Understanding</li>
<li>Exploration of the data.</li>
<li>Data preparation and cleaning.</li>
<li>Implementing the solution</li>
<li>Prediction</li>
<li>Evaluation of the solution</li>
<li>Summary of findings</li>
<li>Conclusions</li>
